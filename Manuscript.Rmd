# Vector autoregression

Following the notation of Tsay (2014) a multivariate time series $z_t$ follows a VAR model of order *p*, VAR(*p*), if

$$
\normalsize 
\begin{aligned}
z_t = \phi_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i z_{t-1} + a_t
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\phi_0$ is a k-dimensional constant vector and $\phi_i$ are k x k matrices for *i* > 0, $\phi_p$ $\neq$ **0**, and $a_t$ is a sequence of independent and identically distributed (iid) random vectors with mean zero and covariance matrix $\Sigma_a$, which is positive-definitive.

### Stationarity condition
A (weakly) stationary time series $z_t$ has time invariant mean and covariance matrix. The eigenvalues of $\phi_1$ determine the stationarity of $z_t$, not he individual elements of $\phi_1$
